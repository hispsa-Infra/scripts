#"Usage: the script is designed to called from a (or the existing) backup script,
# so as to test and verify the backup that has just taken place, and/or to be
# called standalone to test a particular backup file - in either case, the
# script is called and passed a variable of the backup file absolute path.
# If no variable or filename is passed, then the script will build a tree
# of the current location, and all subfolders, and begin iterating through
# all found backup files and testing each one.
# As it works, it logs the process as it goes, to the /tmp folder..."
